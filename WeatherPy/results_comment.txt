Observable trends based on the data

- There is a strong negative correlation between city latitude and max temperature for the Northern hemisphere, meaning that if latitude increases (i.e. going far from equator), the temperature decreases

- There is a strong positive correlation between city latitude and max temperature for the Southern hemisphere, meaning that if latitude increases (i.e. less negative, going closer to equator), the temperature increases.

- There is a slight positive correlation between city latitude and humidity % for the Northern hemisphere

- There is a slight negative correlation between city latitude and wind speed for the Southern hemisphere

- There is no correlation between city latitude and cloudiness percentage, both for Northern and Southern hemispheres
